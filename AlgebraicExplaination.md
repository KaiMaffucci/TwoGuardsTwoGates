This is the algebraic expression for the two guards & two doors problem. I won't repeat myself too much: if you want an explaination for what this is, look at the first two portions of the README. 

To start, there are two guards total. We don't know which is the guard we're talking to, but we know that one of them always tells the truth and one of them always lies. We'll call whatever one tells the truth $G_1$ and the other one $G_2$. We don't know what door is $G_1$ or $G_2$ though. 

$$ |G| = 2 $$

$$ \exists! G_1 \in G $$

$$ \exists! G_2 \in G $$

1: It's the same idea for the doors: there are two of them, we name $D_1$ as the door that leads to heaven, and $D_2$ the one that leads to hell. Like before, we don't know what door $G_1$ or $G_2$ is. 

$$ |D| = 2 $$

$$ \exists! D_1 \in D $$

$$ \exists! D_2 \in D $$

Now this is where the algebraic explaination differs from the purely propositional/logical explaination.
